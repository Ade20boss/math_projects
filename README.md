# ðŸ§® Math with Python

A collection of math-related projects, experiments, and utilities written in Python.  
This repository is my space to explore mathematical concepts through code â€” from basic number theory to applied problem-solving and fun challenges.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
Some of the projects and scripts youâ€™ll find here include:

- **Algebra & Arithmetic** â€“ Solvers, simplifiers, and number crunchers.  
- **Geometry** â€“ Calculations for areas, perimeters, and shapes.  
- **Calculus** â€“ Differentiation, integration, and visualization.  
- **Linear Algebra** â€“ Matrices, vectors, and transformations.  
- **Statistics & Probability** â€“ Random simulations, distributions, and data analysis.  
- **Algorithms** â€“ Math-inspired problem-solving with Python.  

*(More projects will be added as I keep building!)*
